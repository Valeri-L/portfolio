## Portfolio

This is an open-source web application developed using **Vue.js**, **Django**, and **Redis**, hosted on AWS at [portfolio.valerilevinson.com](https://portfolio.valerilevinson.com).

### Features

- **Achievements Section**: Showcases GitHub-Leetcode questions, with updates on each request, caching results for 25 minutes.
- **Git Commits Summary**: Displays a yearly summary of my Git commits.
- **Projects Section**: Provides documentation and blog posts for both private and public projects Iâ€™ve built.

### Template Instructions

To use this project as a template for your own, I recommend setting it up with **Docker** for easier configuration. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` directory and add the following configuration:

    ```env
    SECRET_KEY="your django secret key"
    DEBUG="False"
    LEETCODE_API_URL="https://leetcode.com/graphql"
    REDIS_LOCATION="redis url"
    REDIS_PASSWORD="redis password"
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="your domain / localhost (for development)"
    EMAIL_HOST_USER="email that will send the contact me message"
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD="email password"
    ALLOWED_HOSTS="localhost"
    ALLOWED_HOSTS_99="additional host if needed"
    RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY="integrated recaptcha key"
    ```

3. Run the following Docker command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

    *(Remove `-d` if you want to see the logs of the images.)*

Later, I'll add a more detailed tutorial for setting everything up.
