        <p class="text_regular">When I first started coding, I found myself hopping from one tutorial to another, and taking countless courses. Yet, I realized that I wasn’t truly learning or retaining anything meaningful. That’s when I understood that the best way to learn programming is by building something complex—something that pushes the limits of your knowledge and teaches you important skills along the way.</p>
        <p class="text_regular">I decided to challenge myself by building a game, as games are excellent examples of how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts can be applied. For instance, if you want to reuse a class multiple times, you can create a base class, like Monster, and then extend it with specific subclasses, such as Vampire, which inherits the default methods like attack and defend. This approach made understanding OOP concepts like inheritance and classes much more practical and clear to me—though, of course, OOP goes far deeper than this simple example.</p>
        <p class="text_regular">After some research, I discovered the Pygame library—a lightweight yet powerful engine that is great for building top-down games. Diving into tutorials, I quickly learned that creating a game is far more than just coding classes. It requires structuring your code, planning each step, and managing every aspect of the project.</p>
        <p class="text_regular">I explored the internet and discovered a wealth of free assets and sounds for game development. I even found tools to resize and edit images, ensuring that assets from different sources were compatible. Throughout this project, I gained numerous technical skills: implementing OOP principles, handling frames-per-second (FPS), managing sprites, animating images, and even using geometry to implement features like shooting arrows and fireballs. I also learned that planning and managing assets is far more challenging than I ever imagined.</p>
